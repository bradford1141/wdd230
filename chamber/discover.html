                    This is what the beautiful Coruscant looks like at night. The moon shines bright and you are able to see stars from all
                    across the galaxy. The lights from the tall buildings light up the skyline. In the distance you are able to see the 
                    other planets in the galaxy. This is the captial of the galaxy and is where the Jedi Temple resides.

                    Coruscant during the day is a beautiful place. It is sunny and is fun to look at the passing by ships. The buildings
                    have a unique shape to them that make them stand out. There are lots of big things that go on around Coruscant. This
                    allows for the city to have a night life but also a day life for those who work.

                    city. You are able to look at the city from the sky when you take a flight tour of the city.
